Colora is an HTML5 + Javascript app that consists in a casino-slot-like game where 
instead of figures you have colors, and instead of stopping all of the three boxes 
with one button, you manually stop each of them.

Another difference with a casino-slot machine, is that this app shows the colors 
in each box in a random mode, instead of following an specific order.

At first, there's only five different colors to play with. Each time you reach 
a level, a new randomly generated color is added to the list.

Here is the table that shows how to obtain points:

 ==========================================
|  State					 	| Points  |
|===============================|=========|
| Three boxes are equal			|	200   |
|								|		  |
| Two boxes are equal and next	|	100   |
| to each other					|		  |
|								|		  |
| Two boxes are equal but		|	 50   |
| separated from each other		|		  |
|								|		  |
| The three boxes are different	|	  0   |
===========================================

Futures:
The app needs cookies to save results since it is in its very early stage.
But soon it will be hosting account on the cloud integrating the Fbook and 
Twitter Oauth APIs to make it social.

Also another goal is to integrate:

* Custom colors each time the user reach a new level
* Start with a slower timeout and gradually increase it in each level
* Integrate a timer to make the game more difficult

Licences:
There is no license, and collaborations are welcome.
